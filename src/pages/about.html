            <h1>About Little Lemon</h1>
            <p>
                Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional
                recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have
                a menu of 12–15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with
                moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

            <p>
                Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their
                shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef
                in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic
                Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
